key takeaway:
List Basics & Setup
Creation: Use [] for empty lists or [item1, item2] to start with data.

Indexing: Starts at 0. Use [-1] to grab the last item instantly.

Mixed Data: One list can hold strings, numbers, and booleans simultaneously.

Length: Use len(my_list) to see how many items you're working with.

Editing & Growth
Adding: .append(value) adds to the end; .insert(index, value) puts it exactly where you want.

Updating: Change an item directly with list[index] = new_value.

Joining Strings: '# '.join(list_name) turns a list into a single string separated by your chosen character.

Uppercase: Use .upper() on a specific index to change case: list[0] = list[0].upper().

Slicing & Removing
Slicing: list[start:stop]—remember the stop index is excluded!

Deleting: * .pop() removes and returns an item.

del kills a specific index or the whole variable.

.clear() empties the list but keeps the "container."

Organizing: .sort() puts things in order; .reverse() flips them.

Math & Logic (Level 2)
Stats: Use min(), max(), and sum() for quick calculations.

Average: sum(list) / len(list).

Median: Sort first! For even lists, average the two middle items; for odd, take the center.

Unpacking: Use a, b, *others = my_list to grab the first few items and dump the rest into a new list.

Copying & Merging
Merging: Use the + operator to fuse two lists into one.

Cloning: Always use .copy(). If you use =, changing one list will mess up the other!
