What I Did
Mastered Higher-Order Functions: I learned how to use map, filter, and reduce to transform and clean up data without writing massive, messy loops.

Sorted Complex Data: I took a list of country dictionaries and learned how to sort them by specific keys like name, capital, and population.

Data Analysis: I used the Counter tool from the collections module to figure out which languages are spoken in the most countries.

Level 3 Mastery: I successfully completed the final tier of the challenge by organizing and extracting insights from a real-world style dataset.

How I Did It
Lambdas for Speed: I used lambda functions as shortcuts to tell Python exactly which dictionary key to look at when sorting or filtering.

Safe Data Access: I used the .get() method (e.g., x.get('population', 0)) so that if a piece of data was missing, my program wouldn't crash.

The Counter Trick: Instead of manually counting every language, I "flattened" the language lists into one big group and let Python count the totals for me instantly.

Formatting: I used f-strings with commas (,) to make those huge population numbers look professional and readable.

Mistakes I Made
Import Errors: I tried to import a file (data.countries_data) that didn't actually exist on my computer. I learned that Python can't find files just because they are mentioned in an exercise!

Variable Mismatches: I was calling the data data.countries when the actual variable inside the file was named differently.

Path Confusion: I learned that where a file is saved (its directory) is just as important as the code inside it.

Missing Dependencies: I forgot that reduce and Counter aren't "just there"—they have to be imported from functools and collections first.

How I Solved Them
Self-Contained Code: Since I didn't have the external data file, I brought the data directly into my script. This fixed all my "Module Not Found" errors instantly.

Cleaning the Logic: I simplified the code by removing unnecessary import statements and focusing on the core sorting logic.

Terminal Debugging: I learned to read the error messages in the terminal to figure out exactly which line was causing the trouble.

Consistency: I made sure my variable names matched from the top of the script all the way to the bottom.
