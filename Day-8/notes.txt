Tuples: The Reliable Containers
Immutability: Once you create a tuple, you can't change it (no adding or removing items directly).

Syntax: Defined using parentheses ().

Joining: You can combine two tuples using the + operator to create a brand new one.

Unpacking: Use the asterisk * to "catch" multiple items into a list while assigning others to specific variables.

Slicing: Use [start:stop] to grab specific chunks of data. Remember, the "stop" index is not included!.

Sets: The Duplicate Destroyers
Uniqueness: Sets automatically kick out any duplicate values—perfect for finding unique items in a list.

Unordered: Items don't have a fixed position, so you can't access them by index like set[0].

Adding Data: Use .add() for a single item or .update() for multiple items.

Removing Data: .remove() throws an error if the item is missing, while .discard() stays quiet.

Set Mathematics (Venn Diagram Logic)
Union: A.union(B) joins everything from both sets.

Intersection: A.intersection(B) finds only the items they have in common.

Difference: A.difference(B) shows items in A that are NOT in B.

Symmetric Difference: A.symmetric_difference(B) gives you everything EXCEPT the overlap.

Essential Comparisons
List vs. Set: Lists are for ordered sequences where duplicates are okay; Sets are for unordered groups of unique items.

Tuple vs. List: Tuples are faster and "locked" (immutable); Lists are flexible and "unlocked" (mutable).

String Splitting: Using .split() on a string turns it into a list of words, which you can then toss into a set() to count unique vocabulary.
